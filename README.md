I am Sai Maung Lenn, also known as Meriko, a skilled freelance programmer and developer with a deep passion for both technology and music. I specialize in web development and backend systems, focusing on building functional, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. My technical expertise includes multiple programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C#, Java, SQL, SQLite, Kotlin, and Dart.

Beyond my professional work in software development, I have a strong interest in computer music production, which I pursue as a hobby. Over the years, I have developed numerous Telegram bots and web applications, catering to various needs and enhancing automation processes. One of my most notable projects is Telemeet, a widely used dating bot designed to automate tasks and provide interactive features that improve user experience.
